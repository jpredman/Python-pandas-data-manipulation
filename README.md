manipulation of web-scrapped data in Pandas

Working on a project taking data from a website and transforming it into a PostrgreSQL database to be used in a mapping tool. This is the transforming process of the data that has been web-scraped from http://www.airlinepilotcentral.com/. 

I'm using the Pandas datset in Python to transform the data so it is in the proper schema to load into the PostgreSQL database.
